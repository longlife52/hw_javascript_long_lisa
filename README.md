## Comments
1. Richard, I have heard from Nick regarding Atom's inability to make commit messages. I am hoping you may respond, as well, with any insight.

2. For the howdy function, I was able to have the console.log prompt appear in the console window with out the - howdy(); - therefore, I am wondering if you asked us to invoke the howdy function just to demonstrate that we know how to invoke a function.  Please clarify.

3. I recognized that I needed to return to master to create a new branch after creating a branch off of a branch.  Good lesson learned.

4. In the functions section of the assignment, I was confused by item c -iii. I was able to get the function to run.  However, I do not understand c-iii.  Please explain.
